# Investments in Public Transportation on Property Value in Alameda County  
This study examines whether the expansion of BART to the Warm Springs Transit Center in Fremont, CA, led to an increase in local property values![Bay-Area-Rapid-Transit-logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c500a672-8b94-4ace-b865-cd36575424c8)

Using a regression model, I analyze monthly property values in treatment (ZIP codes 94538 and 94539) and control groups, adjusting for mortgage rates, unemployment rates, and past property values. The key variable of interest is the interaction term between location and post-treatment period, which captures the transit center’s effect on property values.  The study considers historical funding challenges, policy shifts, and external economic factors while aiming to isolate the impact of transit expansion on housing markets.

Property value data was obtained from the publicly available Zillow Research API, along with economic and demographic data from ACS 5-year estimates, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Smart Asset. Due to data availability constraints, I defined treatment and control groups at the ZIP code level rather than more granular geographic units. I addressed multicollinearity by removing highly correlated variables and corrected for serial correlation using clustered standard errors. The study’s findings are limited by the potential for omitted variable bias and simultaneity, as transit investment and property development can mutually reinforce each other.

Ultimately, I failed to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the construction of the Warm Springs Transit Center did not have a statistically significant effect on local property values. The interaction term between post-treatment and treatment group had a coefficient of -0.0584 with a p-value of 0.201, exceeding the significance threshold (α = 0.05). However, mortgage rates and unemployment rates had statistically significant effects, with a 10% decrease in mortgage rates and a 4% decrease in unemployment rates correlating with higher property values. Due to omitted variable bias and multicollinearity constraints, we could not control for key factors like median household income and household size, limiting the generalizability of our findings. Additionally, unobserved factors and random noise introduce endogeneity, making the model less reliable for precise estimation.
